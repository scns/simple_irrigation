**Irrigation scheduler for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) with a built-in dashboard panel — zones, watering cycles & modes.**

- **Watering cycles, not raw cron** — a guided wizard turns *“every 2 days, evenings”* into a working schedule; the panel previews the **next 14 days** live before you save.
- **Three watering modes** — Eco / Normal / Extra, switchable by hand or from automations (weather, tank level, season …).
- **Smart runs** — ordered zones grouped into **phases**, configurable parallelism, and **exclusive** zones that always run alone.
- **Everything in the UI** — Overview · Zones · Schedule · Timetable · Settings. No YAML for zones or schedules.
- **Multiple gardens** — add several installations for different plots or seasonal plans.

Outputs can be any mix of `switch`, `input_boolean`, `group` and `valve` entities. Zones can also use a **duration-aware start service** for irrigation integrations such as Rain Bird, Rachio, Hydrawise, B-hyve / Orbit and OpenSprinkler. Optional **pre-start** outputs (pump / master valve) fire first. Full **English**, **German** and **Italian** translations. Responsive down to the Home Assistant companion app.

**Requirements:** Home Assistant **2024.1** or newer.

## The panel at a glance

| Tab | What it does |
|-----|----------------|
| **Overview** | Live run state with a countdown to the next run, the next few upcoming runs, the active watering mode, and quick actions: *Run next slot now*, *Skip today*, *Pause 48 h* (plus *Stop* / *Skip phase* while running). |
| **Zones** | Named zones with one or more output entities, Eco / Normal / Extra runtimes, an **enabled** toggle and **exclusive** flag. Advanced settings support integration-specific start services that receive the runtime. Filter by **All / Enabled / Issues**, run a zone now, see how many cycles use it. |
| **Schedule** | Your watering **cycles** and single slots. A guided **New irrigation cycle** wizard (daily, every 2/3 days, x-per-week, weekly, every 2 weeks, custom). Every row expands to a **14-day run strip**; multi-slot cycles show their members and can be detached. Per-slot **conditions** gate a run on soil moisture, rain, tank level or any other entity, and per-slot **scripts** override the installation's pre-start / post-run script. |
| **Timetable** | Week-at-a-glance grid (zones × weekdays, morning / daytime / evening) with per-day totals, using the same phase and mode timing as a real run. On phones it becomes a per-day list. Click a run to jump straight to its editor. |
| **Settings** | Installation name (shown in the panel header), optional **pre-start** and **post-run scripts**, pre-start outputs & delay, watering mode, max parallel zones, global **conditions**, default installation, service reference and raw diagnostics. |

## Installation

### HACS (recommended)

1. Open HACS → search **Simple Irrigation**.
2. Click **Download** and restart Home Assistant.
3. **Settings → Devices & services → Add integration** → search **Simple Irrigation**.

### Manual install

Copy the folder `custom_components/simple_irrigation/` into your Home Assistant configuration directory (next to `configuration.yaml`), then restart. Add the integration as above.

---

## First-time setup

1. Complete the **config flow**: installation name, optional pre-start outputs, default mode, max parallel zones.
2. Open the sidebar entry **Simple Irrigation** (admin only). If you have several installations, pick one.
3. On **Zones**, add your zones and their output entities; set Eco / Normal / Extra runtimes and mark any **exclusive** zone.
4. On **Schedule**, click **New irrigation cycle** and let the wizard build the cadence — the 14-day strip previews exactly when it will run before you create it.
5. Use **Timetable** to see the whole week at a glance; click any run to open its editor.

You can add **multiple** config entries for separate gardens or seasonal plans (each appears in the panel picker, and its name shows in the panel header).

---

## Concepts

### Zones

- **Outputs:** any mix of `switch`, `input_boolean`, `group` and `valve` entities. Most use `turn_on` / `turn_off`; valves use `open_valve` / `close_valve`. A zone can drive **several outputs** at once.
- **Runtimes:** three values per zone — Eco / Normal / Extra. The installation’s active **mode** picks which one is used.
- **Exclusive:** the zone never runs in parallel with others (high-flow lines, shared supply, drip circuits).
- **Issues filter:** zones whose output entity is missing or `unavailable` are flagged so you can spot broken wiring at a glance.

#### Duration-aware start services

Some irrigation integrations do not start a zone with a regular `turn_on`. Instead, their start action requires the watering duration in the same service call. Open a zone and expand **Advanced start settings** to configure this behavior.

Built-in presets fill in the service, duration field and unit for:

| Preset | Service | Duration field | Unit |
|--------|---------|----------------|------|
| **Rain Bird** | `rainbird.start_irrigation` | `duration` | minutes |
| **Rachio** | `rachio.start_watering` | `duration` | minutes |
| **Hydrawise** | `hydrawise.start_watering` | `duration` | minutes |
| **B-hyve / Orbit** | `bhyve.start_watering` | `minutes` | minutes |
| **OpenSprinkler** | `opensprinkler.run` | `run_seconds` | seconds |

Choose **Custom** for another integration and enter its `domain.service`, duration field and whether that field expects minutes or seconds. The optional **start target entity** is useful when the start service targets a controller or sensor entity instead of the zone's output entity.

- With a start target, the service is called once for that target. Without one, it is called for every configured zone output in sequence.
- Simple Irrigation waits for the configured mode duration and then sends the normal off/close action to every zone output as a safety measure.
- A failed off action stops the run and is reported, so a potentially open valve cannot go unnoticed while another zone starts.
- Leave the advanced fields empty to retain the normal `turn_on` / wait / `turn_off` behavior.

### Cycles and slots

A **cycle** is a repeating watering cadence. The wizard offers:

| Cadence | Result |
|---------|--------|
| **Daily** / **Weekly** / **Every 2 weeks** / **x days per week** / **Custom days** | a single schedule slot |
| **Every 2 days** / **Every 3 days** | a grouped **cycle** of two linked slots |

Why the split? A slot can water on chosen weekdays and, optionally, only in **odd** or **even** ISO calendar weeks. That covers most cadences in one slot — but a true *every-2-days* rhythm needs two slots on alternating parity (odd weeks Mon/Wed/Fri/Sun, even weeks Tue/Thu/Sat). Only those grouped multi-slot cadences appear as a **cycle** with member rows and a **Detach into single slots** action; everything else is a plain, single slot. Either way, **every row expands to a 14-day run strip** so you can see exactly when it fires.

- **Run order & phases:** the ordered zone list is grouped into **phases** by the *max parallel* limit and *exclusive* flags. The editor shows the phase breakdown live.
- **Optimize cycles:** detects existing single-day slots that together form a known cadence and offers to merge them into one cycle — no re-entry, nothing runs differently.
- **Run now:** *Run next slot now* (Overview), *Run this slot now* (a schedule row) and *Run zone now* (Zones) all use the same pre-start and shutdown pipeline as a scheduled run.

### Conditions

A **condition** states something that must hold for a scheduled run to start — "water, but only while the soil is dry". Each one is an entity, a comparison and a value:

| Operator | Meaning | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **is above** / **is below** | numeric compare (strict) | `sensor.cistern_litres` is above `200` |
| **equals** | numeric compare with tolerance | `sensor.zones_open` equals `2` |
| **state is** | text compare, case-insensitive | `input_select.season` state is `summer` |
| **is on** / **is off** | boolean state | `binary_sensor.rain` is off |

Any numeric entity works — there is no unit restriction, so litres, millimetres, percent and degrees all compare the same way. Rain sensors (`binary_sensor`), manual overrides (`input_boolean`) and helpers (`input_number`, `input_select`) are just as valid as `sensor`.

Conditions live in two places and are combined with **AND** — all must hold:

- **Settings → Conditions:** apply to every scheduled run. This is where a rain sensor or a cistern level belongs.
- **Per schedule slot:** added below the start time, on top of the global ones. A slot can also **ignore the global conditions** — a greenhouse does not care about rain.

Two deliberate behaviours:

- **A broken sensor never stops irrigation.** If the entity is missing, `unavailable`, or its state cannot be read as a number, the run proceeds and a warning is logged. Plants dying because a sensor died is the worse failure.
- **Conditions are checked at start time only.** A blocked run is skipped for that day, not retried later, and the *next run* times shown in the panel ignore conditions — today's sensor reading says nothing about tomorrow's.

Manual runs (*Run now*, *Run zone now*) always start, regardless of conditions.

### Modes, pre-start, pause

- **Watering mode (Eco / Normal / Extra):** chosen on Overview or Settings, or via `simple_irrigation.set_mode` for weather/tank automations.
- **Max parallel zones:** caps concurrency; exclusive zones still run alone.
- **Pre-start / post-run scripts:** optional scripts run **before** the pre-start outputs and **after** the last one goes off — see below.
- **Pre-start outputs & delay:** outputs turned on before any zone (pump / master valve), with an editable delay to build pressure — both configured on **Settings**.
- **Pause / Skip today / Pause 48 h:** affect **scheduled** starts only; an already-running cycle is stopped from **Overview**.

### Pre-start and post-run scripts

Sometimes the garden has to be made ready before a drop of water flows: send the robot mower home, close a window, switch a well pump’s power over — and let it all go back to normal afterwards. **Settings → Pump / pre-start** takes one `script.*` entity for each end of the pipeline and runs it **to completion**:

```
pre-start script  →  pre-start outputs on  →  pre-start delay  →  zones  →  all outputs off  →  post-run script
```

Because the scripts block, they may *wait* — that is the part an automation on `simple_irrigation_run_started` cannot do:

```yaml
# script.mower_go_home — send the mower back and wait until it has docked
sequence:
  - action: lawn_mower.dock
    target:
      entity_id: lawn_mower.garden
  - wait_for_trigger:
      - trigger: state
        entity_id: lawn_mower.garden
        to: docked
    timeout: "00:08:00"
```

- **A stuck script never costs a run.** When the configured **timeout** (default 300 s) expires the script is stopped, a warning is logged, and the run continues anyway — the same fail-open rule as conditions.
- **You can see what it is waiting for.** While a script blocks, Overview says *“Waiting for the pre-start script: …”* under **Preparing** (and the same for the post-run script under **Stopping…**), so a five-minute mower script no longer looks like a hung run. The same detail is on `binary_sensor.<installation>_running` as the `run_state`, `active_zone_ids` and `active_script` attributes, for your own dashboards and automations.
- **Stop** is greyed out while the post-run script runs: the run is already ending, and stopping cannot cut its cleanup short.
- Both run for **every** start through the pipeline: scheduled runs, *Run now*, *Run this slot now* and *Run zone now*.
- The **post-run script** runs at the end of *every* run — finished, failed, or stopped from Overview — so whatever the pre-start script prepared is always undone. `Stop all` therefore waits for it before the run is reported idle.
- Use a **script**, not an automation. `automation.trigger` skips the automation’s conditions by default and silently does nothing when the automation is already running in `single` mode — a silent no-op at exactly the wrong moment. Scripts also take parameters and are what the built-in `script.<name>` blocking call is designed for.

#### Per-schedule overrides

Not every run needs the same preparation: the lawn sprinklers want the mower out of the way, drip irrigation does not care. **Schedule → edit a slot (or the cycle wizard) → Scripts** overrides either script for that schedule:

| Setting | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Switch off (default) | The installation’s script runs. |
| Switch on, entity filled in | That script runs **instead** of the installation’s, with its own timeout (empty = the installation’s). |
| Switch on, entity empty | **No script at all** for this schedule — the drip-irrigation case. |

Scripts belong to the **schedule**, not to the zone: zones run in parallel phases, so a per-zone script would have no single point in the pipeline to run at. Keep zones that need different preparation in different slots rather than mixing them.

When several slots are due in the same minute their zones are merged into one run — and a run has one pre-start and one post-run script. The first overriding slot wins and the disagreement is logged; build slots that do not mix if that matters to you.

### Timetable

- **Grid:** one row group per zone; columns are weekdays (order follows your HA profile’s week start). Three time-of-day rows per zone (morning 0–8, daytime 8–16, evening 16–24), a **total per weekday** footer, and the same phase/mode timing as the runtime. Disabled zones/slots render muted.
- **Odd/even weeks:** a toggle switches between calendar-week parities when any cycle uses them; biweekly runs are drawn dashed.
- **Mobile:** below ~700 px the grid becomes a **per-day list** with the day’s runs and total — no horizontal scrolling.
- **Deep link:** clicking a run opens the **Schedule** editor for that slot (and expands its cycle).

## Automations and services

All services accept an optional `config_entry_id` when you run more than one Simple Irrigation entry (find it in **Settings → Devices & services** or in diagnostics).

| Service | Typical use |
|---------|-------------|
| `simple_irrigation.run_zone` | Start one zone with pre-start, duration from the current mode, then off |
| `simple_irrigation.run_zone_with_duration` | Same pipeline with a fixed duration (minutes) |
| `simple_irrigation.run_schedule_slot` | Run one slot’s full sequence now (`slot_id`) |
| `simple_irrigation.run_due_zones` | Trigger “what’s due now” |
| `simple_irrigation.stop_all` | Stop the active cycle |
| `simple_irrigation.set_mode` | Set `eco` / `normal` / `extra` |
| `simple_irrigation.set_zone_enabled` | Enable/disable a zone |
| `simple_irrigation.pause_until` | Pause automatic runs until a datetime (`until` field) |
| `simple_irrigation.clear_pause` | Clear the pause |

Example — set mode from an automation:

```yaml
action: simple_irrigation.set_mode
data:
  mode: eco
  # config_entry_id: abc123...  # if multiple entries
```

Every schedule slot and per-slot toggle is also exposed as a **switch** entity, so you can enable/disable individual runs from dashboards and automations. Use **Developer tools → Actions** to explore fields with translated descriptions.

## Logs and debugging

- **Home Assistant log:**

  ```yaml
  logger:
    logs:
      custom_components.simple_irrigation: debug
  ```

- **Diagnostics:** **Settings → Devices & services → Simple Irrigation → Download diagnostics**.
- **Panel:** the **Settings** tab has a *Diagnostics (raw run state)* disclosure and a *For automations* block with service names and the `config_entry_id`.

---

## Development

```bash
# Python tests
pip install -r requirements_test.txt
pytest tests/

# Panel (from repo root)
cd custom_components/simple_irrigation/frontend
npm ci
npm run build

# Regenerate screenshots against a running sandbox (see scripts/make_screenshots.js)
cd custom_components/simple_irrigation/scripts && npm i
HA_URL=http://localhost:8123 HA_TOKEN=<long-lived-token> SI_ENTRY=<config-entry-id> \
  node scripts/make_screenshots.js
```

Commit the updated `frontend/dist/simple-irrigation-panel.js` when you change the panel sources so HACS users do not need Node.

## Version management

The version is centrally managed in the `VERSION` file:

```bash
make update-version VERSION=1.0.0   # or: python3 update_version.py 1.0.0
make version                        # show current version
```

This updates `VERSION`, `manifest.json`, `frontend/package.json`, the panel TypeScript/embedded version, and rebuilds `frontend/dist/simple-irrigation-panel.js`.
